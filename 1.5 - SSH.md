| SSH    | 22/TCP|

SSH services provide encrypted access to Unix, Linux and Windows operating systems which allow command line access, file access using the Secure Copy Protocol (SCP), Secure FTP (SFTP) and SSH port forwarding. SSH was developed in order to replace the weak Telnet protocol as it was easily abused by attackers.   

Before 1999, the only SSH servers available were provided by SSH Communication and F-Secure and were used for commercial use. The OpenBSD team worked in late 1999 to provide SSH support for version 2.6 of their operating system, leading to the creation of OpenSSH 1.2.2. It is very popular and is included by default with almost all Unix and Linux distributions. 

Telnet or Netcat can be used to connect to an SSH service and get it's banner in order to display it's version and determine if there are any vulnerabilities related to that particular version. Since we know that SSH is port 22, we can use telnet to connect to it and see if a banner is displayed. 

Here, we can see that this box is running OpenSSH 4.7p1

SSH vulnerabilities depend on three elements: 
- The SSH server and version
- SSH protocol support
- The authentication mechanism that are in use which can be PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules), BSD_AUTH (BSD Authentication), S/KEY (One-time password Authentication) and others. 

# 1.5.1 - Bruteforcing OpenSSH_4.7p1
We can use the ssh_login module in metasploit to attempt to bruteforce SSH logins. 
Kali Linux has a file containing usernames and passwords which we will use to bruteforce the SSH service.

Here, we are setting the RHOSTS to our target address

Here, we have set our user and password file

When we run the module it will try each user and password combination in the file, which can be a slow process, but here we can see that the username "msfadmin" and password "msfadmin" has got us into the SSH service.

Once the SSH service has been bruteforce, metasploit opens another session so we can interact with the box. Using the command `sessions -i 1` we can check that we are inside the vulnerable box.
