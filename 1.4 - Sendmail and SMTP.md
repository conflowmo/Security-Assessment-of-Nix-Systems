Simple Mail Transfer Protocol is a protocol for sending emails throughout several software packages such as Sendmail (Linux), Postfix (Linux) and Microsoft Exchange. All organisations use emails to communicate internally (within the organisation) and externally (with partners and clients outside of the organisation)

Identifying the SMTP service running on a target host will help plan an attack method against the system. 

SMTP banner grabbing is on of the first things that can be done once we have identified the email service port. To grab an SMTP banner we can use telnet to connect to the port. Once we see what software is running we can search for vulnerabilities related to that specific version of the mail server. 

# 1.4.1 - Postfix User Enumeration 

![[Pasted image 20220103150138.png]]

Linux and UNIX OS's run sendmail or Postfix mail servers. Sendmail is vulnerable to information leakage, where an attacker can extract usernames. 

By simply using the VRFY command, which checks to see if a name is in the database, we can check to see if common usernames are present in the mail server, such as <em>root</em> or <em>user</em>. It returns a 252 if the username has been found.

# 1.4.2 - SMTP Enumeration using smtp-user-enum
This tool can be used to guess usernames on an SMTP server. We will use the command:  `smtp-user-enum -M VRFY -U /usr/share/wordlists/fern-
wifi/common.txt -t 192.168.1.7` to try and enumerate the users. Breaking down this command: 
- -M is used to determine the method we use to guess usernames, we are using the VRFY method.
-  -U determines a file of usernames to use, fern-wifi is a wifi cracking program with a built-in wordlist which we are using as a list of usernames. 
-  -t determines the server host running the SMTP service.

We now have a list of valid usernames that are confirmed to be on the SMTP server.

# 1.4.3 - POP-3 (Post Office Protocol)
POP-3 is used as an end-user mail service. After you have successfully performed user enumeration, you can launch a brute force password attack. This is possible because POP-3 does not have an account lockout policy enabled, allowing you to perform a large number of login attempts. It also doesn't log unsuccessful login attempts.
