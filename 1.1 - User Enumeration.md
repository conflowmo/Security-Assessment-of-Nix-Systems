# 6.1.1 - Enumeration using Finger
The Finger protocol is an application level (level 7) protocol that provides an interface between the finger command and the <em>fingerd</em> daemon. The <em>fingerd</em> daemon returns information about the users currently logged into a specific host. It runs on TCP port 79

<em>fingerd</em> has been used since the 1970's and was used to allow users on a network to retrieve information about other users, such as usernames, if a user is active public contact information, GPG keys, and even the IP that a user is connecting from. The finger service can be found on Linux, Unix and Cisco IOS routers. 

Finger is generally not used anymore, however, legacy linux systems could still have it installed, allowing us to perform user enumeration against it. To find out if a system was running Finger we could use nmap and see if it was running on port 79.

[telehack.com](http://telehack.com) is a retro site deliberately running the Finger program, allowing us to see how it works.

Now we know the usernames on the system, such as <em>operator</em> we can run the command `finger operator@telehack.com`, showing us information about that particular user.

Older versions of Solaris have enumeration bugs within their finger service, the command `finger 0@host` will enumerate all users with an empty GECOS field in the passwd file, and the command `'finger 'a b c d e f g h'@host` will enumerate all users on the host target. 

# 6.1.2 - rusers 
The rusers service is a Remote Procedure Call (RPC) service endpoint which listens on dynamic ports. The rusers client utility first connectes to the RPC portmapper and returns the whereabouts of the <em>rusersd</em> service. 

When using nmap to scan a machine you can check to see if the RPC portmapper service is available, the service is on TCP and UDP port 111. You may also use `rpcinfo` to check for the <em>rusersd</em> and other RPC services. 

You can use the command `rusers -l 192.168.1.5` to get a list of users that are logged into the system.

# 6.1.3 rwho
The rwho service listens on UDP 513, and if it is accessible you can use the command <em>rwho</em> to query the service and get a list of current users logged into the remote host.
