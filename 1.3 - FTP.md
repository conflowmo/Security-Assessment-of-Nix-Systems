| Service | Port  |
| --------| ------|
| ftp     | 20/TCP|
| ftp     | 21/TCP| 

File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is used to provide access to files, mostly for the maintenance of web servers, or to serve files to users. TCP port 21 is used to accept and process FTP commands from the client, and TCP port 20 is used to send data from the server to the client. 

FTP servers are vulnerable to: 
- Brute force password attacks
- FTP bounce port scanning and exploit delivery
- Process manipulation such as overflow attacks

# 1.3.1 - Using metasploit to get into vulnerable FTP2.3.4

In this example I am running a basic linux box. If an FTP server has been identified, we can try to connect to it and get it's banner, giving us the version of the server - **vsFTPd 2.3.4**. This is called **Banner Grabbing**

Using this information you could now search the internet for vulnerabilities related to this version of FTP. You can also do this using the Metasploit framework. 


Here, we are searching for a relevant metasploit module for the version of FTP we have.

In this screenshot we are changing the rhosts option to the IP address of our vulnerable box.

Now, if we simply type run, we execute the exploit and we are now in the FTP server.
