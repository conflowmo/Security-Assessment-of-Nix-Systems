One of the first post-exploitation activities that can take place after compromising a target is to get the password hashes and try to crack them offline. If we are successful, then we might be able to escalate our priviliges to the root user.

# 1.2.1 \etc\passwd 

Once the target is exploited, the next step is to view the \etc\passwd file which contains all the accounts on the machine. The passwd file contains seven fields seperated by colons. 
1. The first field is the username
2. The second field is the password field, if it is denoted by an (x) then the password is encrypted and stored in the \etc\shadow file.  
3. The third field is the UID (userID, Linux understands the UID of the user, not the username)
4. The fourth field is the GID (groupID)
5. The fifth field is the GECOS field (contains user information such as the real name of the user)
6. The sixth field is the home directory
7. The last field is the shell of the user

Once the contents of the \etc\passwd file has been retrieved, they can be saved to a local file. The next step is to get the password hashes, located in the \etc\shadow file. You need root privilieges to access this file. There is several important pieces of information you can gather by looking at the \etc\shadow file. 

# 1.2.2 \etc\shadow
This is an example of a hashed password in the shadow file: 
**\$1\$Etg2ExUZ$F9NTP7omafhKlIqaBMqng1**
- The first field is a numeric value which tells us the hashing algorithm being used. 
	- $1 - MD5 hashing algorithm 
	- $2 - Blowfish algorithm 
	- $2a - eksblowfish algorithm 
	- $5 - SHA256 algorithm 
	- $6 - SHA512 algorithm 
	1. The second field is the salt value. The salt value is random data generated to combine with the password in order to increase the strength of the hash. From the above hash the salt is **$Etg2ExUZ**
	2. The last field is the hash value, which is the encrypted password. **$F9NTP7omafhKlIqaBMqng1**

Using a program called hashcat we can attempt to crack this hashed password using a bruteforce in order to see it in plaintext. I have used the command `hashcat -m 500 -a 0 -o cracked.txt shadow.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt` to attempt this. Breaking down this command: 
- -m 500 - m specifies the mode we want to use (MD5)
- -a 0 Attack mode (0 is the default)
- -o is where we want the output stored
- shadow.txt is the file we are cracking
- /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt is the wordlist we want to use (rockyou is one of the most popular wordlists used for cracking.)

This is the output from hashcat after the bruteforce had finished.
